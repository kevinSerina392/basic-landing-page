Hello!

This is a project given by the creators of The Odin Project. 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate all the knowledge
I have gained thus far since starting the course.

In this project you will see my knowledge of: 
    - HTML (elements, tags, lists, images)
    - CSS (foundations, box model, flexbox)
